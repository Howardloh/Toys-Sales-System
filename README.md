# Sales System

## Description
This C++ program is designed to manage a simple sales system for a toy store. It features functionalities for adding new items to the store, updating items, managing billing, and displaying transaction histories. The program stores item and transaction data in text files, allowing for persistence of data across sessions.

## Features
- Add new toys to the inventory.
- Update existing toy details (name, quantity, price).
- Generate billing statements for purchases.
- Apply discounts to transactions.
- Display a detailed transaction history.

After launching the program, follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the sales system. The options include:
1. Viewing all toys information.
2. Adding a new item to the store.
3. Updating an item.
4. Accessing the billing system.
5. Showing transaction history.
6. Exiting the program.

For billing, you can add or delete items from the bill, apply discounts, and finalize the transaction, which will then be recorded in the transaction history.
